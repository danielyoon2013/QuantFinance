Understanding business cycles is critical to investment. This involves analyzing correlations among assets within the market and identifying directional relationships among these assets. If we represent assets as nodes and their relationships as edges in a graph, can we systematically uncover these relationships? Additionally, can we statistically detect the spill-over effects of assets in the market?

#Example:

In the cryptocurrency market, trends such as the following may be observed:
Bitcoin Price Increase → Ethereum Price Increase → Small Alt Coin Price Increase
