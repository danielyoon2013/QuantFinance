Traders often uses butterfly options trades (in -1, +2, -1 weights in the option positions) to invest in the yield curve. The project aims to build a system for identifying such relative value trading signals and create an interactive backtesting tool to assess the performance of butterfly option trades following the signals.

The code aims to identify and test three categories of relative value trades: “range” trades, “curve” trades, and “level” trades. Range trades refer to the mean-reverting trades that are uncorrelated to fly, the belly and the wings. Curve trades focus on the differences between the shortest and longest legs of each fly. Level trades focus on the belly, or midpoint, of the fly. 

Through project, valid butterfly combinations on different yield maturities are observed. Afterwards, alpha signals are generated by calculating z-scores for each butterfly, identifying anomalous signals which are likely to mean-revert and create profit-taking opportunities. The back testing code calculates profits over a three-year period.
